            <p>Well according to github I've been coding for about 4.5 months! However, I've been coding much much
              longer than that on and off. I began using github about 10 months ago but I've been using it more
              seriously for the last 5 months.

            Coding looks hard. Does it involve a lot of math?

            <p>No but to be honest, it all depends on what type of project you're developing. Some projects such as
              a weight converter require
              mathmatical expressions while other projects simply do not. If you're wondering if math is an integral
              part of web
              development, the answer is yes!

            <p>Initially, I had no idea what web development was about when I decided to study it and to be completely
              honest I'm
              still learning what it truly means to be a web developer. Interestingly
              enough though, I discovered that a programmer is who I am at heart. I love using my brain and I love
              to find
              solutions to problems but most of all I love to create things! I believe that the ability to create is
              Gods gift to us as human
              beings. Web development is perfect for my type of
              personality! I guess I got lucky when I picked this one.

            <p>Right now I'm putting in serveral hours a day coding to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
              I'm also tracking my progress everyday on GitHub which is exciting to be able to go back and see all the
              contributions I've made in the past 5 months! In the long run I see myself building successful software
              applications that
              make peoples lives easier - After all, technology is rapidly advancing and people need help navigating
              through these changing times.
